For people already using the overlay, texlive-source has been renamed to
texlive-core, it is recommended to remove texlive-source and install
texlive-core.

Copying texlive-source-2007.tar.bz2 as texlive-core-2007.tar.bz2 in your
distfiles dir and regenerating texlive-core's digest should be all what is
needed before migrating.

Sorry for the inconvenience, hopefully there wont be any other name change.
