We assume that you have successfully setup the overlay, generated the distfiles
and so on.
This file will just be a quick guide on how to switch from tetex to texlive as a
user.

Remove tetex : 
emerge -C tetex

This might have left some files, I had a package collision against a file not
owned by anything : /usr/bin/pdftex ...

ls /usr/bin/pdftex -l
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7 2007-07-09 07:34 /usr/bin/pdftex -> pdfetex

and... of course pdfetex has gone with tetex...

Hey ! This one is useless, thus we can remove it safely : 
# rm /usr/bin/pdftex


# emerge texlive

Go take a coffee.
Tada ! Texlive 2007 should be installed on your system!
