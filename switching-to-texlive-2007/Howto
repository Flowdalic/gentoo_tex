We assume that you have successfully setup the overlay, generated the distfiles
and so on.
This file will just be a quick guide on how to switch from another tex
distribution to texlive 2007 as a user.

Remove your previous tex distribution, for example : 
emerge -C tetex

This might have left some files, I had a package collision against a file not
owned by anything : /usr/bin/pdftex ...

ls /usr/bin/pdftex -l
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7 2007-07-09 07:34 /usr/bin/pdftex -> pdfetex

and... of course pdfetex has gone with tetex...

Hey ! This one is useless, thus we can remove it safely : 
# rm /usr/bin/pdftex

Sometimes, due to some problems with dep calculations and virtual/tetex, portage
will try to install tetex and texlive-core and issue some errors because
they're blocking each other. To workaround this, just type 'emerge -1
texlive-core' before 'emerge texlive'. If you have any suggestion about how to
solve this in a more friendly way, please contact me !

# emerge texlive

Go take a coffee.
Tada ! Texlive 2007 should be installed on your system!
