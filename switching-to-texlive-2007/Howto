Now that texlive is in the main portage tree, it should not be very hard to
install it. 
This file will just be a quick guide on how to switch from another tex
distribution to texlive 2007 as a user.

Remove your previous tex distribution, for example : 
emerge -C tetex

This might have left some files, I had a package collision against a file not
owned by anything : /usr/bin/pdftex ...

ls /usr/bin/pdftex -l
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7 2007-07-09 07:34 /usr/bin/pdftex -> pdfetex

and... of course pdfetex has gone with tetex...

Hey ! This one is useless, thus we can remove it safely : 
# rm /usr/bin/pdftex

Other dead symlinks deserves some care also in order to avoid collisions.

$ find /usr/bin -name "*" -type l ! -xtype f ! -xtype d
should report dead symlinks.

You must empty /var/lib/texmf/web2c, texlive will also install its format files
there. Take care also of other files in this /var/lib/texmf directory for stray
files from other tex distributions.


Once you checked everything:

# emerge texlive

Go take a coffee.
Tada ! Texlive 2007 should be installed on your system!
