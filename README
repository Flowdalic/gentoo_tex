You can find here the modular texlive ebuilds I'm working on.
Unfortunately it is not yet possible to have an overlay that works out of the
box, therefore you'll have to do a few things to be able to install texlive
2007.


First, download both live and inst isos of texlive from
http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/Images/


Then, mount the images : the default location is /mnt/texlive-inst for inst iso,
and /mnt/texlive-live for live iso.

Copy /mnt/texlive-live/source/source.tar.bz2 as texlive-source-2007.tar.bz2 in
your distfiles dir.


Once that done, you have to generate the ebuilds for the modular texmf tree, go
to scripts/texlive/lists subdir and you'll find another README file :)



Reporting bugs / improvements : Just contact me, aballier@gentoo.org, or on irc
(freenode). Feedback, even if it's just to say "that just worked perfectly" will
be very appreciated, so that I'll know how many people tested it, etc.
