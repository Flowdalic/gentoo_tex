Here you'll find a Makefile system to generate ebuilds, distfiles for the
modular texmf tree.


Beware, the makefile system includes /etc/make.conf, so make sure it points to
correct directories for PORTDIR and DISTDIR.
[   Basically : 
    $ grep "PORTDIR=" /etc/make.conf
    should return something like :
    PORTDIR=/usr/portage
    and : 
    $ grep "DISTDIR=" /etc/make.conf
    DISTDIR=/usr/portage/distfiles
    Beware of leading '#', that means the variable definition is commented out,
    just uncomment them, the commented values should be portage's default anyway ]



Note : Never ever use parallel make with this makefile system (make -j>1), it is
made of hacks and will completely break if you do so. However, if you have a fix
for that I'll gladly accept it ;)  [ Note that this has nothing to do with
MAKEOPTS in make.conf, using -j$A_LOT should be sane with the ebuilds, if not,
then it's a bug ;) ]


How to proceed : 
(If you mounted the texlive live & inst isos somewhere else, just override the
variables TEXLIVE_LIVE_MOUNTPOINT and TEXLIVE_INST_MOUNTPOINT)

There are several make targets : 

- make dist : will generate the distfiles and copy them to DISTDIR
- make distclean : will remove the files generated by makedist
- make fulldistclean : will also remove the .zip files copied from texlive iso.

- make ebuilds : will generate the ebuilds
- make ebuilds-install : will install the ebuilds to the location of the
  overlay, generate the digests.




If you just want to get the ebuilds, the only thing you need to type is then : 
make ebuilds-install
