Here you'll find a Makefile system to generate ebuilds, distfiles for the
modular texmf tree.

Note : Now parallel make should be safe to use with this makefile system.

How to proceed : 
(If you mounted the texlive live & inst isos somewhere else, just override the
variables TEXLIVE_LIVE_MOUNTPOINT and TEXLIVE_INST_MOUNTPOINT)

There are several make targets : 

- make dist : will generate the distfiles and copy them to DISTDIR
- make clean : will remove the files generated by make dist

- make ebuilds : will generate the ebuilds
- make ebuilds-install : will install the ebuilds to the location of the
  overlay, generate the digests.




If you just want to get the ebuilds, the only thing you need to type is then : 
make ebuilds-install
