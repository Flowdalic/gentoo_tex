Here you'll find a Makefile system to generate ebuilds, distfiles for the
modular texmf tree.

Note : Never ever use parallel make with this makefile system (make -j>1), it is
made of hacks and will completely break if you do so. However, if you have a fix
for that I'll gladly accept it ;)  [ Note that this has nothing to do with
MAKEOPTS in make.conf, using -j$A_LOT should be sane with the ebuilds, if not,
then it's a bug ;) ]


How to proceed : 
(If you mounted the texlive live & inst isos somewhere else, just override the
variables TEXLIVE_LIVE_MOUNTPOINT and TEXLIVE_INST_MOUNTPOINT)

There are several make targets : 

- make dist : will generate the distfiles and copy them to DISTDIR
- make clean : will remove the files generated by make dist

- make ebuilds : will generate the ebuilds
- make ebuilds-install : will install the ebuilds to the location of the
  overlay, generate the digests.




If you just want to get the ebuilds, the only thing you need to type is then : 
make ebuilds-install
